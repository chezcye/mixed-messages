# Mixed Messages 
For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. **Programming Humor** is my selected theme for this message generator.  
-  Build a random message generator.
- Track progress with Git/GitHub.
- Run the app in Node.js.

**Features:** Here is a screenshot showing the output from running the code in this repository. It illustrates printing a random message based on the random index of the message array.
